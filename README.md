# Listeur v1.x & v2.x - Turbo Pascal - MS-Dos - 1991

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Listeur is a program for printing text files. It lets you add a header and footer. Here are the source codes for the two versions of the project:

* version 1 has been developed for MS-Dos to be used as a classic command
* version 2 uses [Turbo Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) to provide a user interface based on menus, dialog boxes and buttons, usable with both keyboard and mouse, still under MS-Dos.

Developed under [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) between 1991 and 1993, these programs were used at the IUT to print listings for our computer projects.

Of course, they're of no use nowadays, as no-one is expected to print software listings containing several thousand lines of code!

Only the latest version of the source code is supplied. You won't be able to recompile them unless you have a version of Turbo Pascal or Borland Pascal, since the Turbo Vision units used are not public.

The compiled 8-bit version of the programs are supplied. They can be used under MS-Dos or early versions of Windows.
